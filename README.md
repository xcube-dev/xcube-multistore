# Multi-Source Data Store 

This repository aims to delevop a Multi-Source Data Store to formalize the fusion 
of data from various sources into a harmonized data model. This approach will not 
only streamline the integration process but also ensure its **transparency** and 
**reproducibility** through well-defined configurations.

It contains the following steps:

1. Data access through xcube data stores
2. Data harmonization
3. Data fusion if required 

This can result in either one unified data cube with all datasets on a consistent grid
or a catalog of separate datasets.
